- Document PHP version compatibility and extensions
- Provide build and deployment instructions
- Use markdown formatting consistently

### Markdown Compliance Requirements

- **ALL markdown files (.md) MUST pass markdownlint validation with zero errors or warnings**
- Run `markdownlint <filename>` on every markdown file before considering it complete
- Follow the project's `.markdownlint.json` configuration strictly
